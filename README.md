# SpringBootCrudApp
Backend Application Using H2 Database

**Dependencies used ::**
Data Jpa
Spring Web
H2 database

**Structure::**
Models- Where we make the Table/Entity, Id is Autogenerated it is autofilled everytime.
Repository- repository interface, which extends the JpaRepository interface. The UserRepository inherits all the methods provided by JpaRepository for performing CRUD operations on User entities.
Services- Where we make methods like adding an user, deleting and viewing
Controller- where we access the methods defined in Services so we can give them a route and decide if its a post or get method.
      We used @pathvariable for two methods which needed ID as a parameter


**Urls to check these**
- http://localhost:8080/save  - Adds an user to the DB 
- http://localhost:8080/delete/{id} - deletes an user using ID 
- http://localhost:8080/getAll - gets all the users in DB
- http://localhost:8080/get/{id} - gets a single user based on ID
**Make sure to use **POST** method when Adding an User and **Get** for getting users and **Delete** to Delete users while testing in postman.**

Errors encountered-
When Connecting with DB 'spring.jpa.open-in-view is enabled by default. Therefore, database queries may be performed during view rendering. Explicitly configure spring.jpa.open-in-view to disable this warning' inorder to supress this I added "spring.jpa.open-in-view=false" in application.properties
